# Contributing to LangChain.dart

üëã Hi there! Thank you for even being interested in contributing to LangChain.dart.
We welcome contributions of any size and skill level, whether it be in the form of a new 
feature, improved infra, or better documentation.

## üôãWhere to start

If you are not sure what to work on, we have a few suggestions:

- Look at the issues with the "[good first issue](https://github.com/davidmigloz/langchain_dart/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22f%3Agood+first+issue%22)"
  label. These are issues that we think are good targets for new contributors. If you are 
  interested in working on one of these, please comment on the issue so that we can assign it to 
  you. And any questions let us know, we're happy to guide you!
- At the moment our main focus is reaching parity with the Python version across both 
  [integrations](https://langchain.com/integrations.html) and [features](https://langchain.com/features.html). 
  If you are interested in working on a specific integration or feature, just pick anything from 
  those lists not done yet, please let us know and we can help you get started.

Once you have picked an issue, read the rest of this document to get set up and start contributing!

## üó∫Ô∏è Guidelines

### üìÅ Project structure

The project has a modular design where the core `langchain` package provides the LangChain API and
each integration with a model provider, data store, etc. is provided by a separate package
(e.g. `langchain_openai`).

The project is structured as follows:
- `packages`: contains the core `langchain` package and all integration packages.
- `docs`: contains the project documentation.
- `examples`: contains sample apps that demonstrate how to use the LangChain.dart.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Workflow

To contribute to this project, please follow a
["fork and pull request"](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) workflow.

Pull requests cannot land without passing the formatting, linting and testing checks first. See 
[Common Tasks](https://github.com/davidmigloz/langchain_dart/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-common-tasks) 
for how to run these checks locally.

The project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages.
This allows us to automatically generate the changelog and release notes. We use the following types:
- `feat`: a new feature.
- `fix`: a bug fix.
- `refactor`: a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- `test`: adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
- `docs`: documentation only changes.
- `chore`: changes to the build process or auxiliary tools.

After the type comes the scope, we use the component name indicated in the issue (e.g. `chains`, `llms`, etc.).
If it is a breaking change, append a `!` after the type/scope (e.g. `feat(chains)!: ...`).
At the end of the commit message, add the ticket number (e.g. `#123`).

These are some examples of valid commit messages:
```
feat(memory): Add support for ConversationTokenBufferMemory (#26)
fix(agents): Allow to add memory to an agent executor (#80)
refactor(memory): Extract default memory key and prefixes to constants
tests(memory): ChatMessageHistory removeLast and removeFirst (#82)
docs(agents): Add example of using memory in OpenAIFunctionsAgent (#91)
```

It's essential that we maintain great documentation and testing. If you:
- Add a new feature
  * Add relevant documentation (API docs, project docs, examples, etc.)
  * Add relevant unit or integration test
- Fix a bug
  * Add a relevant unit or integration test
- Make an improvement
  * Add or update relevant documentation (API docs, project docs, examples, etc.)
  * Add or update relevant unit or integration test

If you add a new major piece of functionality, it is helpful to add an example to showcase how to
use it. Most of our users find examples to be the most helpful kind of documentation.

Examples can be added in the `examples` directory of the repository. Each example should contain
a README that explains what the example does, and how to run it.

We're a small, building-oriented team. If there's something you'd like to add or change, opening a pull 
request is the best way to get our attention.

### üö© GitHub issues

Our [issues](https://github.com/davidmigloz/langchain_dart/issues) page is kept up to date
with bugs, improvements, and feature requests. There is a 
[taxonomy of labels](https://github.com/davidmigloz/langchain_dart/labels) to help with sorting and 
discovery of issues of interest. These include:

- [doc-loaders](https://github.com/davidmigloz/langchain_dart/labels/c%3Adoc-loaders)
- [doc-transformers](https://github.com/davidmigloz/langchain_dart/labels/c%3Adoc-transformers)
- [prompts](https://github.com/davidmigloz/langchain_dart/labels/c%3Aprompts)
- [llms](https://github.com/davidmigloz/langchain_dart/labels/c%3Allms)
- [chat-models](https://github.com/davidmigloz/langchain_dart/labels/c%3Achat-models)
- [output-parsers](https://github.com/davidmigloz/langchain_dart/labels/c%3Aoutput-parsers)
- [chains](https://github.com/davidmigloz/langchain_dart/labels/c%3Achains)
- [memory](https://github.com/davidmigloz/langchain_dart/labels/c%3Amemory)
- [stores](https://github.com/davidmigloz/langchain_dart/labels/c%3Astores)
- [embeddings](https://github.com/davidmigloz/langchain_dart/labels/c%3Aembeddings)
- [retrievers](https://github.com/davidmigloz/langchain_dart/labels/c%3Aretrievers)
- [agents](https://github.com/davidmigloz/langchain_dart/labels/c%3Aagents)
- [tools](https://github.com/davidmigloz/langchain_dart/labels/c%3Atools)

We also have a [kanban board](https://github.com/users/davidmigloz/projects/2) for tracking the 
progress of issues through the development process.

If you start working on an issue, please comment on it and we will assign it to yourself.

If you are adding an issue, please try to keep it focused on a single modular 
bug/improvement/feature. If the two issues are related, or blocking, please link them rather than 
keep them as one single one.

We will try to keep these issues as up to date as possible, though with the rapid rate of develop 
in this field some may get out of date. If you notice this happening, please just let us know.

### üôã Getting help

Although we try to have a developer setup to make it as easy as possible for others to contribute 
(see below) it is possible that some pain point may arise around environment setup, linting, 
documentation, or other. Should that occur, please contact a maintainer on our 
[Discord](https://discord.gg/x4qbhqecVR)! Not only do we want to help get you unblocked, but we 
also want to make sure that the process is smooth for future contributors.

In a similar vein, we do enforce certain linting, formatting, and documentation standards in the 
codebase. If you are finding these difficult (or even just annoying) to work with, feel free to 
contact a maintainer for help - we do not want these to get in the way of getting good code into 
the codebase.

## üöÄ Quick start

Our primary goal is to make it as easy as possible for you to contribute to this project.

This project uses the following tools, which are worth getting familiar with if you plan to 
contribute:

- **[melos](https://melos.invertase.dev)** - a tool for managing Dart monorepos.
- **[linter](https://dart-lang.github.io/linter)** - official Dart linter.
- **[analyzer](https://pub.dev/packages/analyzer)** - official Dart static analyzer.
- **[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)** - a CI/CD tool for GitHub repositories.
- **[docsify](https://docsify.js.org)** - static site generation for documentation.

To get started, run:

```bash
melos bootstrap
```

This will install all the dependencies and set up the monorepo. If you don't get any errors, 
you are good to go!

## ‚úÖ Common tasks

### Formatting

We use [dart format](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-format) to enforce 
[code formatting style](https://github.com/davidmigloz/langchain_dart/blob/main/analysis_options.yaml).

To run the formatter, run:

```bash
melos format
```

It will automatically fix (most) format errors.

### Linting

We use the official [linter](https://dart-lang.github.io/linter) and 
[analyzer](https://pub.dev/packages/analyzer) to enforce 
[standard rules](https://github.com/davidmigloz/langchain_dart/blob/main/analysis_options.yaml).

To run the linter, run:

```bash
melos lint
```

### Testing

To run all tests, run:

```bash
melos test
```

If you only want to run the tests for the packages that have changed compared to `main`, run:

```bash
melos test:diff
```

## üìÑ Documentation

The [API reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/langchain/latest/) docs are automatically 
generated from the code. For that reason, we ask that you add good documentation to all classes 
and methods.

The general [langchaindart.com](http://langchaindart.com) docs are written in Markdown and live in
the `docs` directory. The static site is generated using [docsify](https://docsify.js.org). If you 
add a new major piece of functionality, please add a page to the docs that explains how to use it.

You can run a hot-reloading version of the docs static site by running:

```bash
docsify serve docs
```

## üè≠ Release process

As of now, LangChain has an ad-hoc release process: releases are cut with high frequency via by
a developer and published to [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/langchain).

LangChain follows the [semver](https://semver.org/) versioning standard. However, as pre-1.0
software, even patch releases may contain
[non-backwards-compatible changes](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4).

To create a release, run:

```bash
melos version -V langchain:x.x.x --no-private
```

This command will bump the version in the `langchain` package and all packages that depend on it.
It will also update the CHANGELOG.md for each package, commit the changes and creates tags.

Create a new release on GitHub and copy the CHANGELOG.md content into the release description.

After that, you can publish the package to pub.dev:

```bash
melos publish --no-dry-run
```

Finally, drop by the [Discord](https://discord.gg/x4qbhqecVR) and let everyone know about the new
release!
